      "inlineTranscriptBody": "<p>Hey, hey, welcome to Sketchy EVM! I'm your host, Anthony Croco, and today we're talking about 'no significant difference.' This is something that even the most EBM savvy people sometimes make mistakes with, so I think it's worth spending a few minutes talking about it. You may have had this happen before, where you're reading a research paper and in the conclusions, you read 'no significant difference.' It may occur to you to wonder, does this mean that they are the same?</p><p>Well, the pediatrician in me wants to explain this in a simple way using colored circles, so please bear with me. In the first box, we have two circles, a green one and a red one, and they are distinctly occupying different spaces. In the third box, we have a green circle and a red circle occupying the exact same space. And in the middle box, the green circle and red circle occupy some of the same space. It's easy to see that the two circles in the first box are different, and the two circles in the third box are the same. However, the two circles in the middle box aren't really 100% different, and they're not really 100% the same either. Let's use this to understand articles.</p><p>One of the most common types of research questions that we'll see in research papers asks the question: Is A better than B? So, what the authors are in fact trying to prove is that two things are different, one being better than the other. If the authors fail to do this, then we have to accept the null hypothesis, which is, in fact, that they are unable to show that A is significantly better than B. But they haven't, in this case, proven that they are the same.</p><p>One of the other common types of research papers that we'll come across asks the question: Is A equal to B, or are they the same? In this case, the authors are trying to show that these two things are equal. If they fail to do this, the null hypothesis then is that these two things are not significantly the same, but they haven't actually proven that they're significantly different.</p><p>So what I'd like to do now is go through a real-world example of a paper that I've heard misquoted a number of times. This is a paper by Zeng, and it's a Cochrane systematic review examining the question: Do infants with bronchiolitis benefit from nebulized hypertonic saline? I can tell you, there's about six months of the year where the majority of my patients present with bronchiolitis, so the burden of disease is significant here, and the question is a good one. Does hypertonic saline nebulized offer more benefit than normal saline nebulized to these patients? And the outcome measure we're looking at for this example is hospitalization.</p><p>I've redrawn the forest plot for you here, and you can see that the diamond summarizes the data, with the highest point of the diamond in the middle being our point estimate, which is 0.63, in favor of hypertonic saline showing more effect. The confidence intervals extend from 0.37 to 1.07, sadly crossing the line of no significance, which in this case is 1. This means that the results are not significant, and the authors have correctly concluded that no significant short-term effects were found.</p><p>The question you may ask yourself then is, does this result mean that hypertonic saline doesn't work? In fact, this is not what the results are saying at all. What the authors are able to show is that the bulk of the data shows that there is an effect, but unfortunately, the confidence interval crosses the line of no significance. At best, we can use an EBM naughty word, 'trend,' to say that there is a trend for effect, but we don't like to use this word. The best we can say is that there's no significant effect.</p><p>One of the author's final conclusions is that more trials are needed, and I would agree. So at the end of the day, my take-home message for you is this: The absence of proof of effect does not prove absence of effect. Well, I hope you've enjoyed this episode of Sketchy EBM. Please do take the time to evaluate, and until next time, remember to always draw your own conclusions.</p>",
